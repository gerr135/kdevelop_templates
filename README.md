# kdevelop_templates
A collection of kdevelop-5 templates (new projects and files) for less common situations and languages.

This is a collection of templates for kdevelop v5 for creating new projects and file types that I needed but found missing in the kdevelop itself or on the import source website. (NOTE: there is some Ada project template in kdevelop extras that you can pull down and install, ut that one is ancient, for kdevelop v4-, so it does not work any more and on top of that is package manager specific (forgot Debian or Ubuntu).

The templates are organized in subdirs:
proj/  for projects
file/  for file types
syntax/ just the syntax highlighting

for convenience, all template are packed and stored under export/ dir, so you can cimply copy these to appropriate kdevelop locations:
for projects:  /usr/share/kdevappwizard/templates/
for files:     /usr/share/kdevfiletemplates/templates/
